## State Management & Local Storage  

### useState:  
- Used to manage the state of the **search input, weather data, recent searches and theme**.  

#### Example states:  
- `data` â†’ Stores the fetched weather details.  
- `city` â†’ Holds the user input for city name.  
- `history` â†’ Stores previously searched cities.  
- `theme` â†’ Stores the theme dark or light mode.  

---

### useEffect:  
- Used to **fetch weather data** when a city is searched or any change in city.  
- Used to **load recent searches from localStorage** when the page is reloaded or visited again.  
- Triggers updates when `city` or `history` updates.  

---

### Local Storage:  
- Saves **recently searched cities** so they persist after page reload upto 5 of them.  
- **Retrieves saved searches** when the website is reopened.  

#### Example usage:  
javascript
localStorage.setItem("cities", JSON.stringify(updatedHistory));

const [history, setHistory] = useState(() => JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("cities")) || []);
